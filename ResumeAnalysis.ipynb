This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.  I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS) product.  I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed the idea that they should move from \"selling\" software to \"renting\" it via an up and coming model SaaS.  Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring revenue.  I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.  As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.  Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.

After promotion I continued to server as the project manager for the 2.5 million dollar system rollout which ranged from gathering the business requirements for the design and deployment to creating the processes and managing the team to for the roll out to ~2000 users across Los Angeles County.  In this capacity I managed a project support team including administrators, help desk staff and trainers.  As the IT Manager, I supervised network administrators and was responsible for all high level network design and architecture for the organization.

I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient, up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.  The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.  I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner.  I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.  I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.  While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my vendor negotiation skills.  I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.  My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.  Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile capability to access our document management system.  I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times.  Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite.  Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite.  Upgraded the GroupWise Messaging to Outlook Messaging.  Upgraded the Worldox document management system to Worldox GX3.  Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging.  Assisted the Marketing department to implement a firm wide Client Relationship Management (CRM) system.  Setup up Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) systems at two regional offices.  Implemented and upgraded many of100 technical applications and systems used at the firm on an as needed basis to improve efficiency.  Implemented several mobile applications on attorney personal devices to improve efficiency (VPN connectivity, RDP clients, Dictate digital dictation, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Mobile Suite of applications, Linkedin, Business Card Scanner, Twitter, etc.) The firm experienced minimum unplanned system downtime under my watch and my team and I oversaw and provided training on the many various applications, processes and procedures used in business operations.  I am an experienced data security officer with the skills and knowledge to ensure data is adequately protected.  I was the firm's Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations.  It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing \"ease of use\" while ensuring system and data \"security.\" Every year my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review.  Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing techniques.  I am an experienced project manager with the skill set, knowledge and interpersonal tools required to ensure the timely and efficient implementation of systems and applications.  I enjoy the aspects of project management as it involves \"cradle to grave\" involvement.  Interacting with the users to determine their technical and budget needs, interacting with vendors, communicating with my peers and self-study to find the right technology to meet the need, testing the application and processes or feasibility and efficiency, documenting the processes and procures involved, preparing user instructions and finally implementing and training users on the new system.  I appreciate the resources, processes and procedures required to ensure system efficiency and readiness.  At the firm most applications are hosted at the central office with the regional offices connecting with redundant Ethernet connections, this saves on the cost of having data centers and support staff at each firm location.  My team and I have also authored the firm's business/continuity/disaster recovery plan for IT applications and systems.  The firm decided the priority and timeliness of systems and applications to recover.  I and my team have configured many IT systems to fail over to the backup systems automatically which is barely noticeable to users.

      "Having prior experience in IT field, exploring the field to be with children lead to do the Early Childhood Education course and be the part of the little bud's life.      Skills    apple, Art, book, Oral, concept, conflict resolution, CPR, creativity, Designing, direction, Documentation, First Aid, Flash, fundraising, drawing, instruction, Materials, meetings, organizing, philosophy, express, Read, Recording, Safety, sound, teacher, Teaching, Transportation        Experience     09/2010   to   09/2011     Information Technology Analyst    Company Name          I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.  Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually.  I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.  Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.  My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.  Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.  I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.  Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and themselves.  Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.  Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the children.  Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a great feeling.  Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.  Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.  Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.  Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend more time in school than any other place.  I believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor activities during the supporting weather.  I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in outdoor group activities.  A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy foods, and less sodium and sugar.  I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.  I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.  Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school leaving the parents.  My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.         01/2010   to   08/2010     Technology Analyst    Company Name               10/2006   to   06/2008     Software Engineer    Company Name               07/2004   to   10/2006     Project Engineer    Company Name          I am attaching hereby the Conduct Certificate and Experience Certificate from previous organization.

Demonstrated commitment to quality and customer service, detail oriented, strong team player, self motivated, demonstrated exceptional analytical skills, proven ability to work effectively and cross functionally with all levels of management with responsibilities increasing in scope. 9+ years of experience as Client/Server developer using Transact SQL, PL\\SQL, Classic ASP, ASP.net, HTML, DHTML, XML, JavaScript, using CSS layout and design principles. 7+ years of managing project timeliness, accuracy, approving high-level and detail designs, as well as managing successful test plans. Directed all stages of software development including requirements, design, coding, testing and implementation of several company wide Intranet initiatives like Ovations! - An associate rewards and recognition program used by over 30,000 employees; Kronos TM Workforce Central - a time and attendance program for 13,000 non-exempts employees. Several projects included the management of offsite vendor resources. Experience using the following database management tools MS SQL Server 6.5,7, 2000 and 2005, My SQL, and Oracle 9i. Proficient with MS Windows, MS Office, Minitab, Business Objects, Adobe CS3 Web Edition, Visual Studio, Frontpage, PaintShop Pro.           Experience      Information Technology Coordinator     Nov 2003   to   Current      Company Name       Provide technical support throughout the office from building and managing the web presence, networking computers and other office equipment as well as researching grant opportunities for the implementation of a technology component for the Leadership SOAR program. Responsible for building capacity for the foundation within the area of information technology by helping them move closer to a paperless environment. The scope of my role is to streamline IT operations, implement an effective online marketing and media strategy, automate the work processes for employees, and centralize the activities of GivingBack Foundation, Inc. by using the internet and other media.       Web Developer     Jun 2003   to   Current      Company Name       As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System Development Life Cycle. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed design specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems using Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux Hosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key ASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software. Clients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.       Intranet Application Support Analyst     Jan 2003   to   Jul 2007      Company Name       Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99% compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague. Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to 7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10 - 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

When you are writing letters, it's important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.  Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.  It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn't fit well on a page.  Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.  Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.  Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.  It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.  Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter.  Here's how to space your cover letter.  When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.  If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar.  Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size.  You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.  How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter.  Highlight the content of your letter.  Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.        Experience      Production Associate   03/2006   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State       cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.  Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.  A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.  Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.  A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.  Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.  There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek.  Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).  Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).  The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.  Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.  Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

TECHNICALS SKILLS: Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio 2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.
